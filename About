This is my second capstone project prepared for M2M ~ Data Talent Program 
Cohort 13, Feb 2025
Project Overview:
  This project is a learning exercise for me as I develop my skills in data science and machine learning. I am fully aware that the notebook contains a high number of visualizations, and the notes may sometimes feel like a stream of consciousness. However, this approach was intentional for the following reasons:

>  Practice & Application â€“ This is my first machine learning project, and I wanted to apply as many of the methods I have learned as possible.
>  Self-Documentation â€“ I structured the notebook to serve as a personal reference so I can revisit my learning process in the future.
>  Feature Selection Simplicity â€“ While I could have chosen more features for clustering, I deliberately opted for two to keep the analysis straightforward and focused on understanding the core mechanics of K-Means.

I appreciate any feedback and suggestions, but please keep in mind that this is a work in progress from someone still in training. Every step in this project is a reflection of my learning journey. ðŸš€
